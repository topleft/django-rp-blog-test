    That code in my care
    That sly command-line stare
    That strips my operating system bare
    It's whichcraft

This package provides cross-platform cross-python ``shutil.which`` functionality.

Usage
=====

On Linux, Mac, Windows for Python 2.6, 2.7, or any of the 3s:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from whichcraft import which
    >>> which('date')
    '/bin/date'
    >>> which('calendar')
    '/bin/calendar'
    >>> which('cookiecutter')
    '/Users/pydanny/.envs/fun/bin/cookiecutter'
    >>> which('a-made-up-name') is None
    True


Notes
=====

This is a shim of the ``shutil.which`` function that's designed to work across
multiple versions of Python and inside of windows. The code for Python 2.x is
based on Python 3 code that I extracted from source. I originally did this for
Cookiecutter_ but pulled it out in order to reduce line count for that project.
